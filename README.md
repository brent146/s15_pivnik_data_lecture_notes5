http provides a function called createServer()

Node is mainly used to write servers/services

First class functions - anonymous function that's created in place

console.log() is the printf() of the Javascript world.

Event Loop - for GUI programs "If user click here, do this"

add functions - process.nextTick(), setImmediate(), setTimeout(), setInterval(), etc.

Main program is simply a function passed to the event loop

After setting interval it can be cleared so everything will terminate neatly
